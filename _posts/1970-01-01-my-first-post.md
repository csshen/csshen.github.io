Hello and welcome to my website/blog. My website is pretty empty right now, but I hope to change that soon. I just rebuilt my website using Jekyll and added an area for blog posts. I plan on populating it with some of the projects I have been working on. Stay tuned!

If you're wondering about the timestamp of this post, January 1st, 1970 is the beginning of the UNIX epoch. Most UNIX operating systems encode time using a single, real number; Unix time keeps track of the seconds elapsed from midnight on January 1st, 1970. Thus, the "beginning of time" for computers is January 1st, 1970. You can read more about Unix time [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
