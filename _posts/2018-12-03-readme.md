Hello there! If you are reading this you have probably seen that the blog section of my website is pretty empty right now. I'm working hard to change that! I just redesigned this site using Jekyll and added a section for blogging. I plan to put up posts about my travels abroad and some cool software and hardware projects I'm working on. Stay tuned!
